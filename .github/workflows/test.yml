      # Note: Visual regression baselines in tests/__screenshots__/ are platform-specific.
      # If baselines were generated on Windows but tests run on Linux (this CI), font rendering
      # will differ. To fix: run `npx playwright test --update-snapshots` on Linux (or in CI)
      # and commit the updated baselines.
